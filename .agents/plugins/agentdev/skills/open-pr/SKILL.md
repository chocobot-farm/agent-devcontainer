# Open PR

This skill instructs AI agents on how to create GitHub pull requests from conversation context
with meaningful titles and proper formatting. The AI agent
should analyze the conversation, extract PR details, and create the pull request directly
without pausing for confirmation.

## GitHub MCP Tools Required

This skill may use GitHub MCP tools for GitHub operations or `gh` CLI commands if available and authenticated.

Required MCP tools:

- `github/create_pull_request` - create the pull request

Optional MCP tools (for validation and follow-up):

- `github/list_issues` - list recent issues when issue number is missing
- `github/list_pull_requests` - check for existing PRs from the same branch
- `github/pull_request_read` - fetch PR details after creation

## PR Description Source of Truth

The PR body content **MUST** be generated using the
[pr-gen-description](../pr-gen-description/) skill.

The open-pr skill is responsible for:

- optional issue linking in title/body when issue context exists
- delegating mandatory formatting and validation to the `local-reformat` skill
- delegating staging and commit creation to the `git-commit` skill
- delegating branch sync with `origin/main` to the `update-branch` skill
- remote branch verification
- GitHub PR creation through MCP

## Bundled Scripts

Use these exact helper scripts instead of retyping inline shell commands:

- [review-git-changes.sh](scripts/review-git-changes.sh) reviews the working tree, diff stats, patch, and commit log for the PR context.
- [ensure-remote-branch.sh](scripts/ensure-remote-branch.sh) verifies upstream tracking, pushes the branch when needed, and blocks on divergence.

The detailed PR description structure, section requirements, and quality checks
are defined in the [pr-gen-description](../pr-gen-description/) skill
and **MUST NOT** be duplicated here.

## Workflow for AI Agents

When this skill is invoked, the AI agent **MUST** follow these steps:

### 1. Context Analysis Phase

Review the entire conversation history and git changes to extract PR details:

- Identify what work was completed during the conversation
- Review git diff and git status to see actual changes made
- Extract key details: what was changed, why, which files were affected
- Determine the type of changes (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
- Check if there's a related issue number mentioned in the conversation (optional)

Context signals for PR type:

- Feature signals: new functionality added, new files created, capabilities extended
- Bugfix signals: fixed error, resolved issue, corrected behavior
- Refactor signals: improved code structure, reorganized code, better patterns
- Documentation signals: updated README, added comments, wrote guides
- Test signals: added test coverage, modified test cases

### 2. Mandatory Local Reformat

**CRITICAL:** Before reviewing, committing, or creating a PR, the AI agent
**MUST** invoke and follow the `local-reformat` skill.

Run every formatter and validation required by that skill. Do not substitute a
partial set of formatters or bypass failures. If `local-reformat` cannot
complete successfully, stop PR creation and report the actionable failure to
the user.

### 3. Commit Any Uncommitted PR Scope

After `local-reformat` completes successfully, inspect `git status`. If the
PR-scope changes are uncommitted, invoke and follow the `git-commit` skill to
stage only that scope and create one conventional commit before drafting a PR.

If the caller already created the scoped commit (for example,
`implement-agent-specs`), verify the branch is clean for that scope and do not
create a duplicate or empty commit. If a formatter leaves new tracked changes,
commit those changes before continuing. Do not reimplement the commit-message
or staging workflow inline.

### 4. Branch Sync with `origin/main`

**CRITICAL:** Before the final change review or PR-body generation, sync the
current branch using the `/agentdev:update-branch` skill.

The AI agent **MUST** invoke and follow the `/agentdev:update-branch` skill instead of
re-implementing merge logic inline.

If `update-branch` reports unresolved conflicts or requires user input, stop
PR creation and ask the user to resolve or confirm conflict decisions first.

### 5. Post-sync Formatter and Commit Check

Branch synchronization can introduce formatter changes. Run the required
`local-reformat` workflow once more after `update-branch`. If it changes
tracked files, invoke `git-commit` to make one focused formatting commit. Do
not continue with formatter edits left uncommitted.

### 6. Final Git Changes Review

**CRITICAL:** After the branch is synchronized and clean, the AI agent
**MUST** review the actual git changes:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/review-git-changes.sh
```

Use `--base-ref <ref>` or `--range <range>` when the comparison base is not `origin/main`.
This script ensures the PR description accurately reflects the final code
changes that the PR will contain.

### 7. Optional Issue Linking

Issue linking is recommended but not required.

**How to find an issue number when available:**

1. Search conversation history for explicit issue references:
   - "for issue #42"
   - "closes #15"
   - "related to #23"
   - GitHub issue URLs containing issue numbers

2. If no issue number is found in conversation:
   - Check if there are recent issues that match this work:
     - Use `github/list_issues` with repository `owner` and `repo`
     - Start with `state: open`, `perPage: 10`
     - If needed, broaden query with `state: all`

- Ask the user if they want to link an issue: "Would you like to link an issue to this PR?"

3. If no issue is provided:

- Continue PR creation without issue linking
- Use a concise title without issue prefix

### 8. PR Draft Construction

Generate the PR description by following the
[pr-gen-description](../pr-gen-description/) skill.

Use the generated output as the PR body, and use one of these title formats:

- If issue is available: `[#issue-number] Brief description`
- If issue is not available: `Brief description`
- Keep the title description concise and outcome-focused

### 9. Proceed Without Confirmation

Do **not** pause to ask the user to approve the draft. Once the title and body
are generated, continue directly to remote verification and PR creation. If
any later operation changes the branch diff, re-run the Final Git Changes
Review and regenerate and review the title and body before creating the PR.

- Do not present the draft and wait for a "yes" before creating the PR
- Still stop and surface the issue to the user only when a blocking error
  occurs (e.g. push divergence or a failed PR creation) — these require user
  input to resolve
- After the PR is created, report the resulting PR URL/number

### 10. Remote Branch Verification

**CRITICAL:** Before creating the PR, verify the current branch exists on the remote repository.

Run the bundled helper:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ensure-remote-branch.sh
```

The script handles these cases:

- no upstream branch: pushes with `-u <remote> <branch>` using the configured `--remote` value or the default remote
- local branch ahead of upstream: pushes changes to the configured upstream
- branch up to date: exits successfully without pushing
- branch behind its upstream: exits non-zero with fast-forward recovery instructions
- branch diverged from upstream: exits non-zero with merge-based recovery instructions
- `--remote` conflicts with the configured upstream remote: exits non-zero so the user can reconcile the remote selection
- current branch is `main` or `master`: exits with a warning so the agent can ask for confirmation before continuing

Use `--remote <name>` or `--branch <name>` when the default remote or branch should be overridden.

If the script exits non-zero, display its actionable error output and abort PR creation.

### 11. GitHub PR Creation (MCP)

Once the branch is on remote, create the PR using `github/create_pull_request`.

Use the tool with these fields:

- `owner` (required): repository owner
- `repo` (required): repository name
- `title` (required): full PR title
- `head` (required): source branch name
- `base` (required): target branch (usually `main`)
- `body` (optional): PR body (include Summary, Changes, Testing, optional Related section)
- `draft` (optional): set to `true` for draft PR
- `maintainer_can_modify` (optional): set per repository policy

**Important:**

- The body should be the generated markdown from the
  [pr-gen-description](../pr-gen-description/) skill
- Do not duplicate or re-interpret the prompt's section requirements here
- If `base` is not explicitly provided by user/repo policy, set `base: main`.
- After successful creation, display the PR URL/number returned by the MCP tool
- Confirm: "Pull request created successfully: [URL]"

**Optional parameters:**

- Set `draft: true` if the user wants to create a draft PR
- Set `base: <branch>` if targeting a different base branch

### 12. Error Handling

Handle common error scenarios gracefully:

**Issue number not found:**

```
No related issue number found.
Proceeding without issue linking.
```

**No git changes:**

```
Cannot create PR: No changes detected in the working directory.
Please make and commit your changes first.
```

**GitHub MCP authentication/authorization failure:**

```
GitHub MCP request failed due to authentication or missing permissions.
Please verify MCP server authentication and token scopes (typically `repo`).
```

**Not on a feature branch:**

```
Warning: You're on the main/master branch.
PRs should typically be created from feature branches.

Create a new branch with:
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Or confirm you want to create a PR from the current branch.
```

**No conversation context:**

```
I don't have enough context to create a PR. Could you please provide:
- What changes were made?
- What was tested?
```

**PR creation failed:**

```
Failed to create pull request: [error message]
Please check GitHub MCP connectivity, authentication, and required tool permissions.
```

**Merge conflict while syncing with `origin/main`:**

```
Cannot continue PR creation: merge conflicts occurred while merging origin/main.
Please resolve conflicts, commit the merge, and retry PR creation.
```

## Ownership

The AI agent **SHALL NOT** claim authorship or co-authorship of the pull request.
The PR is created on behalf of the user, who is **FULLY** responsible for its content.

Do not add any "Created by AI" or similar attributions to the PR body unless
explicitly requested by the user.
