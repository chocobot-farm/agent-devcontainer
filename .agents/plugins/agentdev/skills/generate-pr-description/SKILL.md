# Generate Pull Request Description

Generate a comprehensive PR description by analyzing the change set and filling the pull request template of the repository being worked in — `.github/pull_request_template.md`, or a file under `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`. Use [code-review-standards](../code-review-standards/) for wording and review conventions, and use the Coding Conventions section of that repository's root `AGENTS.md` only for shared quality expectations rather than repeating them here.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a pull request for code changes
- Need detailed PR description that explains changes
- Want to follow project conventions for PR documentation
- Preparing for code review
- Documenting technical decisions and assumptions

## Prerequisites

- Changes committed to a branch
- Understanding of what was changed and why
- Related GitHub issues identified (optional)
- Testing performed

## Inputs

- **Base Ref** or **Commit Range**: Default to the PR merge base with
  `origin/main`; accept an explicit range when the caller provides one.
- **Related Issues**: GitHub issue numbers
- **Breaking Changes**: Yes/No
- **Migration Steps**: If breaking

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Git Changes

```bash
base_ref=origin/main
merge_base="$(git merge-base "$base_ref" HEAD)"
git diff --name-status "$merge_base"..HEAD
git diff "$merge_base"..HEAD
git log --oneline "$merge_base"..HEAD
git diff --stat "$merge_base"..HEAD
```

Use the merge base rather than a raw `origin/main..HEAD` range when the branch
and its base have diverged: PR review compares the changes introduced by the
head branch since that common ancestor. If the caller supplies an explicit
commit range or the PR targets a different base branch, use that scope instead.

Categorize: new, modified, deleted, renamed.

### Step 2: Identify Change Categories

Features, Bug Fixes, Refactoring, Tests, Documentation, Configuration, Performance, Security.

### Step 3: Extract Technical Details

For each significant change: purpose, approach, files affected, dependencies, side effects.

### Step 4: Identify Related Issues

Search commits and branch name for #123, GH-456. Link issues, design docs, related PRs.

### Step 5: Assess Testing Strategy

Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing, coverage impact.

### Step 6: Check Breaking Changes

API changes, config changes, dependency version changes, schema changes.

Identify any required migration work such as config changes, rollout order, data backfills, operator actions, or compatibility notes.

### Step 7: Generate The Description

Locate the repository's pull request template — `.github/pull_request_template.md`, or a file under `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` — and start from it, following the wording rules from [code-review-standards](../code-review-standards/). When the repository has no template, use the section list below as the structure instead. Remove sections that do not apply, and ensure the final PR description covers the same information required by the template:

- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences
- **What Changed**: Group related changes instead of listing files
- **Why**: User or system impact
- **How to Test**: Actual verification performed
- **Breaking Changes**: Only when applicable
- **Migration**: Required rollout, upgrade, backfill, or operator steps
- **Related**: Issues, design docs, or follow-up work

### Step 8: Review and Validate

Ensure completeness, technical accuracy, valid links, and that testing matches actual work. Confirm that the final description stays in sync with the repository's pull request template (or, when it has none, with the section list in Step 7) and does not repeat generic review or clean-code checklists from the referenced documents.

## Edge Cases

- **No changes**: Report error, check branch/commits
- **Too many changes**: Summarize categories, detail significant only
- **No tests**: Warn incomplete testing section
- **Multiple unrelated changes**: Suggest splitting PRs

## Related Resources

- The repository's pull request template: `.github/pull_request_template.md` or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`
- [code-review-standards](../code-review-standards/)
- Coding Conventions in the repository's root `AGENTS.md`
