# Implement Agent Specs

Implement a selected program under `docs/agents/specs/` as a sequence of small,
independently reviewable pull requests that all target `main`. Dependent spec
branches may stack commits so implementation can continue before their prerequisite
PRs merge. One numbered spec produces exactly one branch, commit, and pull request.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user provides a numbered spec path or a spec program name
(for example, `locomotion`, `roadmap`, or `formatting-linting`) and asks to
implement it, continue the program, implement a numbered range, or ship the
program in order.

## Inputs and Selection

Accept either a program directory name below `docs/agents/specs/` or a path to one
numbered spec file. Read the root specs README, the owning program README, and the
candidate spec before changing code.

- With a single spec path, implement that exact spec after checking its documented
  dependencies and the program's ordering constraints.
- With no spec number, select the lowest-numbered spec file still present in the
  program directory.
- With a requested number or range, process only that selection, in numeric order.
- Treat a missing earlier numbered spec as landed only when the program README says
  it landed or otherwise records it as complete. Do not silently skip a missing,
  undocumented prerequisite.
- Check the program dependency table and the candidate spec's own prerequisites.
  Stop and report the unmet dependency; do not implement around it.
- Preserve the program README's ordering even when independent dependency branches
  would permit parallel work. Numeric program order is authoritative for this
  workflow.

When the request is ambiguous about whether to continue, complete only the next
eligible spec. Continue to another spec only when the user requests it, either in
the initial range or in a later message.

## Coordinator and Worktree Rules

For one requested spec, a single implementing agent may perform the workflow.

For two or more requested specs, the main agent is a coordinator only. Assign one
implementing subagent to each spec. Dispatch them sequentially when dependencies
or stack order require it; do not let two agents edit the shared checkout or the
same branch concurrently.

Give each implementation agent a separate Git worktree below `./.tmp/` and its
own branch. Create `./.tmp/` first if necessary. Never use `$TMPDIR`. The agent
for spec _N+1_ starts only after spec _N_ has committed successfully. Base a spec
with an unmerged dependency on the dependency's branch so it inherits the required
commits; otherwise, base it on refreshed `origin/main`. The coordinator verifies
the prior commit, chosen commit base, and pull-request number before dispatching the
next agent.

The coordinator must not implement production changes, tests, or documentation for
an assigned spec. It selects work, prepares isolated worktrees, provides each agent
its spec path and base branch, tracks the resulting PR, and reports status.

## Per-Spec Workflow

1. Create a descriptive branch, such as
   `spec/<program>-<number>-<short-slug>`. Base a root or independent spec branch on
   refreshed `origin/main`. When the spec depends on an unmerged predecessor, base
   its branch on that predecessor's branch and record every inherited predecessor
   PR. Do not flatten, squash, or rebase inherited commits without an explicit
   request.
2. Read the full spec, its dependency specs as needed, the program README, and
   repository `AGENTS.md`. Identify the owning modules, acceptance criteria,
   behavior changes, and the spec's **Test plan (write first)**.
3. Implement with TDD: write and demonstrate the specified failing test, make the
   minimal implementation pass, then refactor while keeping tests green. Apply the
   repository's relevant language, formatting, and build/test skills. Run commands
   through `uv run` (Python) or `bun` (JavaScript) and scope them to the narrowest
   path or test id.
4. Run the spec's required validation and any directly affected focused checks.
   Record the actual commands and results. Do not claim unrun checks passed.
5. Resolve the documentation only after implementation and validation succeed:
   update the owning program `README.md` to mark the spec's listed findings as
   resolved/landed, including a PR number only when it is known. Follow any
   program-specific instructions for additional finding indexes. Remove the
   completed numbered spec file in the same commit. Keep the program ordering table
   accurate so the next invocation selects the right spec.
6. Review the staged diff against this spec's stack base, not `origin/main` for a
   later stacked branch. Ensure it contains only the current spec's implementation,
   tests, status update, and deleted spec file. Preserve the inherited commits from
   predecessor branches unchanged. Also review `origin/main...HEAD` to inventory
   every predecessor PR included in the branch.
7. Stage only those files and create one conventional commit. Use the
   [`git-commit`](../git-commit/SKILL.md) skill to derive the message from the staged
   diff.
8. Push using local Git commands only. Never use a GitHub API or MCP tool to move
   branch refs or push branch contents. Then create a pull request with the
   [`generate-pr-description`](../generate-pr-description/SKILL.md) and
   [`open-pr`](../open-pr/SKILL.md) workflows. Tell `open-pr` that this
   per-spec commit already exists; it must verify the committed scope rather
   than create a second commit. If branch synchronization or the final
   formatter pass creates new changes, `open-pr` owns the single follow-up
   formatting commit before it publishes the PR.

## Main-Targeted Pull Requests

Create every pull request against `main`, including PRs whose branches inherit
commits from unmerged predecessor branches. Never set a predecessor spec branch as
the GitHub PR base. Confirm `baseRefName` is `main` immediately after creation and
correct it before continuing if necessary.

Create the first/root PR as ready for review. Create every PR that includes an
unmerged predecessor PR as a draft. Keep it draft until every included predecessor
has merged and the branch has been reconciled with the updated `origin/main`.

Each PR title and main description must discuss only its own spec. For a draft
dependent PR, add a dependency section that lists every included predecessor PR in
merge order and explicitly says they must merge before this PR becomes ready:

```markdown
## Dependencies

This branch includes changes from:

- #123
- #124

Merge these PRs in order before marking this PR ready for review.
```

Confirm the root PR is not a draft and each dependent successor is a draft after
creation. Do not repeat predecessor changes, include a combined program summary,
or claim that the whole program is complete.

If the PR number is required to mark a finding resolved, create the PR after the
code commit, then make a small follow-up commit on the same branch that records the
actual number before updating the PR. That follow-up remains part of the same
per-spec PR and must contain no other work.

## Completion and Blockers

Report each completed spec with its branch, commit, PR URL, GitHub base (`main`),
commit stack base, draft state, included predecessor PRs, resolved findings,
removed spec file, and validation results. Then either move to the next explicitly
requested spec or stop.

Stop and ask for direction when a required dependency is neither landed nor in the
requested stack, a test exposes an out-of-scope design decision, the working tree
contains overlapping user changes, push authentication is unavailable, or PR
creation fails. Do not mark findings resolved or delete a spec file when its
implementation or required validation is incomplete.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] The skill name and directory are `implement-agent-specs`.
- [ ] The description contains what the skill does, when it triggers, and spec/PR keywords.
- [ ] A request for multiple specs uses one subagent and isolated worktree per spec.
- [ ] Every implementation uses numeric order, dependency checks, TDD, and focused validation.
- [ ] Every completed spec is a distinct branch, commit, and PR targeting `main`.
- [ ] Dependent branches preserve required predecessor commits without using a predecessor PR base.
- [ ] The root PR is ready; dependent PRs are drafts that list included predecessor PRs.
- [ ] The program README marks only actually resolved findings and the completed spec file is deleted.
- [ ] `validate_agent_files --ci .claude` passes.
