  cat <<'EOF'

Usage:
  codespace-exec.sh <command> [args...]

Runs '<command> [args...]' on the codespace, inside the repo's workspace
directory, over 'gh codespace ssh'. Everything after the script name is
forwarded verbatim as the remote command -- including '-h'/'--help', which
is passed through to the remote command rather than being intercepted by
this script.

Examples:
  codespace-exec.sh uv run pytest py_packages/validate_agent_files
  codespace-exec.sh bun test

Exit codes:
  *  Whatever the remote command exits with, passed straight through.
     This is not "0 on success" in the usual sense -- 0 only if the
     remote command itself succeeded.
  2  No command given, gh missing, or plain auth failure / missing
     codespace name.
  3  Under-scoped token (missing 'codespace' OAuth scope).
